# Discord Backup Bot
**PLEASE READ: If you feel like the program is a bit shady, you can read the source code but if you don't know how to code, ask an ai what it does.**

A bot that backups all your info.

It can be helpful if you keep getting terminated but you have a strict antivirus since most backup bots need to off your antivirus.
All your info will be saved in the same directory as the application so no need to worry about where the info goes! (it takes some time to generate the txt files).
